    I <em>love</em> Dogs!
  </h1>

      Dogs love me!
    </h2>
    <p>
      I have only had a total of four dogs my in my life thus far; <em>however</em>, each of them served a vital and <strong>distinct</strong> purpose.

    <p>
      I sometimes think <em>maybe</em> it'll be a good idea if I adopt another dog, despite them being a <strong>huge</strong> responsibility.
